64bit has some more issues due to jvm. I didnt proceed further on 64bit. Here is the list for 32bit. 

Here is the list of commands and manual interactions I did to make things work for me. Attached 2 patch fine one is for gcc and other is for mosync.

mkdir $HOME/mosync

export MOSYNCDIR=$HOME/mosync

sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc g++ bison flex ruby rake subversion rpm libgtk2.0-dev libexpat1-dev libbluetooth3-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libfreeimage-dev gperf libssl-dev git libwebkitgtk-1.0-0

mkdir $MOSYNCDIR/bin

mkdir -p $MOSYNCDIR/libexec/gcc/mapip/3.4.6

mkdir $MOSYNCDIR/src

cd $MOSYNCDIR/src

git clone git://github.com/MoSync/gcc.git gcc_trunk

 

# Apply gcc patch

 

cd $MOSYNCDIR/src/gcc_trunk

./configure-linux.sh

cd build/gcc

make

 

cp gcc/xgcc gcc/cpp $MOSYNCDIR/bin

 

# Download mosync nightly build and extract mosync code to $MOSYNCDIR/src/mosync_trunk

# Apply mosync patch

 

cd %MOSYNCDIR/src/mosync-trunk/

./workfile.rb CONFIG="debug"

./workfile.rb CONFIG=""

 

cd $MOSYNCDIR/src/

 

git clone -b ThreeTwoOne git://github.com/MoSync/Eclipse.git eclipse_321

 

# Download http://www.mosync.com/down/target-platform.zip and copy to target-platform.zip  com.mobilesorcery.sdk.product/build/

 

cd com.mobilesorcery.sdk.product/build

 

ant release

cd buildresult/

cd I.MoSync/

cd MoSync-linux.gtk.x86-unzipped/

 

chmod +x mosync

 

# Copy profiles/ from windows installation of same nightly build of mosync to $MOSYNCDIR/. (It should match exactly same version of windows and mosync you compiled.)

# For some reason, BlackBerry directory under profiles/platforms/ and profiles/vendors doesnt seems to be working. It should be deleted in order to make MoSync IDE work.

# Since, I'm not a concern about BlackBerry I have removed them from my profiles directory.

 

#### At this point, mosync IDE should come up fine and MoRE emulator should be working fine.

 

# For real android, this is what I have done and worked fine for me in Galaxy S2.

# I copied aapt,zipalign from "http://dl.google.com/android/adt/adt-bundle-linux-x86-20130219.zip". Made softlink for unzip to /usr/bin/unzip.
